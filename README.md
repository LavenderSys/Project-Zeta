A small movement based shooter scripted with GD Script in the Godot Engine. 
This was inspired by Quake,Half-Life, and the GoldSource Engine as a whole, seeking to produce the atmosphere of a retri shooter built with the express intent of being fun to move around in. I did NOT Create the initial movement script for this techdemo, just edited the shit out of it to fix as many problems as i could.

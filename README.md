A small movement based shooter scripted with GD Script in the Godot Engine. 
This was inspired by Quake,Half-Life, and the GoldSource Engine as a whole, seeking to produce the atmosphere of a retri shooter built with the express intent of being fun to move around in. I did NOT Create the initial movement script for this techdemo, just edited the shit out of it to fix as many problems as i could.

Shout out to Miziziziz and Garbaj for their fantastic tutorials which have helped immensely through this whole thing!

The Center of the map (shapes and placements of the three cubes, as well as the walls, but not their textures) is a base environment made by another developer for another FPS script, I changed it around a little, but still want to give them credit. Sadly, I don't remember the creator of that environment at the moment, I will link when I find it.
